diffuse10
=========

Setup
-----
You need ChucK to run the backend code for diffuse10. Run the diffuse10.ck file, making the appropriate modifications to the files being sent to the different diffusion octagons. This can now be front end controlled via Processing or over iOS. Setup the IP address to be the same on the ChucK script as well as the front end code.

Use
---
Once everything is running, simply touch/click on the different octagons to pan everything on that octagon appropriately.
